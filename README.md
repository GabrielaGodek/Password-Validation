# <center>Project #3</center>
### <center>Password Validation</center>
<div align="justify">
This is the <u>fourth</u> of few smaller and simpler project I create during course <i>JavaScript by Mateusz Maj.</i>
In this project I made a password validation.

## How it works
Run the `index.html`.

In inpute row you should provide same numbers, letters and special characters and everything should be longer than ten characters. If you do that then you should see a green message below inform that you provide a save password. Otherwise you will see gold message inform that the password is good enough or the provide input is not satisfied which means password is too weak.
